//todo: In a large scale application, we need to make more customized widgets rather than flutter default widgets. Suppose we need to make use of our own custom RaisedButton, FlatButton, OutlineButton, Divider, CircularLoader, etc which we can use throughout our application then that kind of customization widgets we can add inside the file widget.dart which will be present inside the folder widgets
